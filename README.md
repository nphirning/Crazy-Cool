# Crazy-Cool

**The Project:**  
> Code generation for the Classroom Object-Oriented Language (COOL) implemented in C++. 

**Important Note:** 
> This is the ***best*** COOL code generator on the market. 

## Setup Instructions

The generator is written in C++ 11. So the instructions follow:

* Make sure C++ 11 is installed on your system.
* Compile the C++ files in the `src` directory (if you want, you can inspect the Makefile for inspiration on how to do this). 
* The resulting executable will work. Read the section on input flags for customization.

## Input Flags

I'll do this later.
